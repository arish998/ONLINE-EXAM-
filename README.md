A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called Read Me, READ.ME,[1] README.TXT,[2][1] README.md[1] (for a text file using markdown markup), README.1ST[1]  – or simply README.[1]

The file's name is generally written in uppercase letters. On Unix-like systems in particular this makes it easily noticed – both because lowercase filenames are more usual, and because traditionally the ls command sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order, so that uppercase filenames appear first.[nb 1]
